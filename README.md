# SAR-Wave-Height

Neural network model used to predict significant wave height from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in [*Deep Learning for Predicting Significant Wave Height From Synthetic Aperture Radar*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9143500) by Quach, et. al. 2020.

- The example_model Jupyter notebook contains the code for the model and evaluation.
- The sherpa_example Jupyter notebook demonstrates Sherpa integration with runner file combinedNoVal.py
- The generator.py code is used for passing data in batches to Keras
